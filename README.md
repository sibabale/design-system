##### Ozow UI is a design system that is meant to be a reusable set of components that can be quickly used to build and scaffold any application. Current it is used to demo a UI library for [Ozow](https://ozow.com).

Note: this design system is not used in Ozow's UI. This is purely for experimental reasons and is not the property of Ozow.

## Our Approach

We use Atomic Design by [Bred Frost](https://bradfrost.com/) to scope and organise our UI components.

## Why

The Storybook design system codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Storybook's design patterns.

#### What we're doing

- Build and maintain a design system in the open
- Share UI components between multiple apps
- Dogfood upcoming Storybook features
- Welcome contributors of all levels and backgrounds

#### What we're not doing

- Rewrite all new components from scratch
- Overhaul the visual design of components
- Compete with more general design systems like ANT or Material.
