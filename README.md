##### Ozow UI is a design system that is meant to be a reusable set of components that can be quickly used to build and scaffold any application. Current it is used to demo a UI library for [Ozow](https://ozow.com).

Note: this design system is not used in Ozow's UI. This is purely for experimental reasons and is not the property of Ozow.

## Tech stack

Building components

- ‚öõÔ∏è [React |](https://reactjs.org/) declarative component-centric UI
- üìö [Storybook |](https://storybook.js.org) for UI component development and [auto-generated docs](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a)
- <üíÖüèæ> [Styled Components |](https://www.styled-components.com/) for component-scoped styling

Maintaining the system

- üì¶ [NPM |](https://www.npmjs.com/) for [packaging and distribution](https://blog.hichroma.com/how-packaging-makes-it-dead-simple-to-share-ui-components-29912593539d)
- [Auto |](https://intuit.github.io/auto/)Streamline release workflows and automate publish constantly!
- ‚úÖ [Chromatic |](https://www.chromatic.com/) to prevent UI bugs in components (by Storybook maintainers)

## Our Approach

We use Atomic Design by [Bred Frost](https://bradfrost.com/) to scope and organise our UI components.

## Why

The Storybook design system codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Storybook's design patterns.

#### What we're doing

- Build and maintain a design system in the open
- Share UI components between multiple apps
- Dogfood upcoming Storybook features
- Welcome contributors of all levels and backgrounds

#### What we're not doing

- Rewrite all new components from scratch
- Overhaul the visual design of components
- Typescript (the consumer apps don't use it)
- Compete with more general design systems like ANT or Material.
